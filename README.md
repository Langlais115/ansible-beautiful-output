# Beautiful Output
This role ships with a callback plugin to allow you to display the execution of
your playbook on a very beautiful way (in my opinion.)

## Requirements
The control machine has to have the `watchdog` python libraries installed prior
of running your playbook with this callback setup.

Dependencies
------------
No dependency to any other Role.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: townk.beautiful_output
